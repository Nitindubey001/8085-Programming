# ‚öôÔ∏è 8085 Assembly Language Programs

Welcome to my **8085 Microprocessor Assembly Programs** repository!  
This repository contains **16 well-structured 8085 programs** covering arithmetic, logical, looping, data transfer, and conversion operations.  
It‚Äôs built mainly for **practice and learning**, with clear file organization and simplicity for beginners.

## üõ† Requirements

To run these programs, you need an **8085 Assembler/Emulator**:

- [GNUSim8085](http://gnusim8085.org/) (Linux/Windows)  
- [8085 Simulator IDE](https://sourceforge.net/projects/emu8085/) (Windows)  
- Or any other 8085 emulator of your choice
